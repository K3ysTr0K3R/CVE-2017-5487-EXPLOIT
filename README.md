# CVE-2017-5487-EXPLOIT
In the REST API implementation of WordPress 4.7 before 4.7.1, there is a vulnerability present in the wp-includes/rest-api/endpoints/class-wp-rest-users-controller.php file. This flaw occurs due to inadequate restrictions placed on the listings of post authors, thereby enabling remote attackers to acquire sensitive information through a wp-json/wp/v2/users request.
